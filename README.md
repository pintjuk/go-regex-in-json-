# Go Regex WebAssembly Demo

This project demonstrates how to use Go's regular expression library in JavaScript via WebAssembly (Wasm). It includes a simple HTML interface where users can input a regex pattern and text, with the results displayed dynamically. The project also wraps the WebAssembly functionality in a JSDoc-typed JavaScript library (`regexLib.js`) to provide a clean API.

## Features

- Uses Go's regex library compiled to WebAssembly.
- Provides a simple HTML form to test regex patterns against text.
- Clean JavaScript API with JSDoc typing for ease of use.
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, modern look.

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (1.11+ for WebAssembly support)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for serving files locally)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-regex-webassembly-demo.git
   cd go-regex-webassembly-demo
   ```

2. **Compile the Go Code to WebAssembly**:
   Use the included `Makefile` to compile the Go code (`main.go`) to WebAssembly.

   ```sh
   make build
   ```

   This command will generate `goregex.wasm` in the project directory.

3. **Start a Local Server**:
   Serve the project over HTTP to avoid cross-origin issues:

   ```sh
   make run
   ```

4. **Open the Demo**:
   Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to view the demo.

## Makefile Usage

The Makefile provides the following commands:

- **`make build`**: Compiles the Go code (`main.go`) to WebAssembly, outputting `goregex.wasm`.
- **`make run`**: Starts a local HTTP server on port 8080 using Python's `http.server` to serve the project files.
  
## File Structure

- `main.go`: Go file that exports a regex matching function.
- `regexLib.js`: JavaScript library that wraps the WebAssembly functionality with a simple API.
- `index.html`: Frontend with a form to test regex patterns.
- `wasm_exec.js`: JavaScript runtime required by Go for WebAssembly.
- `goregex.wasm`: Compiled WebAssembly binary (generated by `make build`).
